# Homesite-Quote-Conversion

Before asking someone on a date or skydiving, it's important to know your likelihood of success. The same goes for quoting home insurance prices to a potential customer. Homesite, a leading provider of homeowners insurance, does not currently have a dynamic conversion rate model that can give them confidence a quoted price will lead to a purchase. 

Using an anonymized database of information on customer and sales activity, including property and coverage information, Homesite is challenging you to predict which customers will purchase a given quote. Accurately predicting conversion would help Homesite better understand the impact of proposed pricing changes and maintain an ideal portfolio of customer segments. 

(1) Experiment with SMOTE (or its variations) using different percentages to get a higher accuracy on minority class prediction.

(2) Perform ensemble predictions (one-layer stacking) by combining predictions from the various algorithms. For stacking, try at least five different models - e.g. decision tree, random forest, support vector machines, multilayer perceptron and K-nearest neighbors.

(3) In addition, perform hyperparameter tuning on the stacked model. You can do hyperparameter tuning on individual models if you want, but that is not necessary.
